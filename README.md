# LGMVIP-Data Science Internship
### Task 1- Beginner Level Task
###  IRIS Flower Classification
This machine learning project is the benchmark project for any beginner in Machine Learning and usually referred to as the "Hello World". The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes.
There are 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.


### Task 2- Beginner Level Task
### Image to Pencil Sketch with Python
We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.


### Task 3- Intermediate Level Task
### Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
Decision Tree Classifier is a tool that has applications spanning several different areas. Decision trees can be used for classification as well as regression problems. The name itself suggests that it uses a flowchart like a tree structure to show the predictions that result from a series of feature-based splits. It starts with a root node and ends with a decision made by leaves.


### Task 4- Advanced Level Task
### Develop a Neural Network that can read Handwriting
The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs).
The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).
The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.
